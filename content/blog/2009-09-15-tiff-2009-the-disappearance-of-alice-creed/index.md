Two men kidnap a girl. That's pretty much all I can say about [_The Disappearance of Alice Creed_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379177/) without giving away the various twists. What I found interesting about this film was that the three main characters are the only people in the whole movie. Also, almost the entire story takes place within 2 rooms in an apartment, and everything develops from the dialogue and interaction between the characters and the performances, which were great. In that sense, it's kind of like a play. On the other hand, it's shot with some stylish cinematography, which gives it sufficient "movie-ness" that you might not even notice how small the scope is. (Some people in the audience actually chuckled when the credits rolled and they realized that there were only 3 people in it.)  
  
Excellent acting, great script, great style, and some very cool and unexpected twists. My favourite of the festival so far.
