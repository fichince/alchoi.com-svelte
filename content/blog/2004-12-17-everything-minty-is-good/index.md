Yesterday I washed my hair with this newfangled Head & Shoulders shampoo called "Refresh". It's basically shampoo with mint, and it supposedly creates a refreshing, "wake-me-up" feeling. To me, it felt like washing my hair with Vicks VapoRub while eating a Halls and brushing my teeth at the same time. I was coughing and sputtering and my eyes were stinging... a generally unpleasant experience.  

I can just picture the marketing people who came up with this..  
 
Marketing Executive #1: "I've got an idea... minty shampoo."  
 
Marketing Executive #2: "Excellent idea!"  

Marketing Executive #1: "Yes... because everything minty is good!"  
  
Marketing Executive #2: "Wait... didn't you also invent Sprite Ice?"  
  
What's next, Bacon Double McMinty with Cheese?
