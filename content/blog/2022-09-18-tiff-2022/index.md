TIFF this year was special because it was my first time attending in person since COVID. The digital screenings that they did the past two years were appreciated but it’s not really TIFF unless you’re juggling schedules and scrambling to get between screenings. I present these short reviews in no particular order:

# [_Raymond & Ray_][1]

When my grandmother passed away earlier this year, my father gave a eulogy which moved me, and further, made me think about how I might speak about him when that inevitable day comes. I don’t have the musical skill to blow a plaintive jazz trumpet solo, like Ethan Hawke’s character does in this film; nor do I have access to a revolver with which to fire six roaring rounds into their father’s casket, like Ewan McGregor’s character does. Neither of them speaks a single word; their eulogies are delivered with raw bodily manifestations of their troubled emotions. I had imagined myself, in the future, frantically typing out the words the day before the ritual, pages and pages of text meant to honour and soothe. But after watching this film, I realized that when I stand there at the pulpit, those words will already have been written. I will have been writing them for my whole life.

# [_Luxembourg, Luxembourg_][2]

The film tells the story of a pair of young men, twin brothers, who receive word that their estranged father is dying in Luxembourg. One of the brothers wishes to make the trip from their hometown in Ukraine, but the other brother has exorcised all love for their father and wants nothing to do with him.

This seems to set up the main conflict, but the film spends its first half without showing the brothers together much. Each of them go about their own lives and have their own misadventures (accidental workplace injury for one, shitty in-laws for the other), but neither of their storylines gets resolved when the second half rolls around and they suddenly decide to make the trip to Luxembourg after all.

Throughout the film, I found myself confused by the smattering of chuckles throughout the audience at odd times. For example, there’s a scene where our protagonist, having purchased a defective, sinking rubber ducky bath toy, brings it back to the toy store in a drunken rage, and waves a gun at the clerk. I believe the filmmakers were going for a kind of dark humour, but I was disturbed by the potential of violence.

There were some cool filmmaking techniques—flashy edits, camera moves and zooms, _&c_—but between the disconnected story and the uncomfortable tone, I can’t say it enjoyed it very much.
