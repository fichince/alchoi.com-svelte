So there's this new "flavour" of Tylenol called Tylenol "Cool Burst". You know what it is? It's minty Tylenol. _Minty!_ **_Tylenol!!_**  
  
Why is this even necessary? The ideas of pills is that you swallow them. Do they really want people to pop in a couple of Tylenols and start sucking on them like candy? "Mmm... minty... refreshing... maybe I'll have 10 more."  
  
I'm getting pretty tired of this notion that everything has to be minty. The only things that should be minty are mouthwash, breath drops, toothpaste and other oral hygiene products. I don't want to eat it, I don't want to drink it, I don't want to wash my hair with it. Just take your mint and keep it to yourself, thank you.
