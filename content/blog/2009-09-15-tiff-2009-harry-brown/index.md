[Michael Caine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/) plays [_Harry Brown_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289406/), a retired widower living in a bad neighbourhood overrun by drug gangs. And then his friend gets hurt. And then he starts killing gang members. And then the cops get involved. That's what I felt like when I was watching this movie... it was just a sequence of plot events. I never got a sense of the characters' motivations and justifications for their actions. The characters were only there to move the plot along, and I didn't care about them at all.  
  
For example, there's one scene where the police detective (played by [Emily Mortimer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607865/)) suddenly goes from being confused about the situation to being _completely convinced_ that she's solved the case, all based on what I think was a very vague piece of evidence. Up to that point, she was portrayed as a fair and thoughtful detective, but then abruptly jumps to a conclusion, only because that's what was needed for the movie to set up its climax.  
  
Overall, it was a disappointment. That being said, there are some moments of suspense that did work well, e.g., the scene where Harry goes to buy a gun from some nasty people. And Michael Caine delivers my favourite one-liner from the festival so far. After a shootout with a bad guy, he stands victoriously over his injured opponent and says: "You failed to maintain your weapon, son." Brilliant.  
  
**2 out of 5**
