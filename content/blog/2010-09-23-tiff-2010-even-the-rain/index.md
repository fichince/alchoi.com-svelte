In [_Even the Rain_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1422032/), a Spanish film crew, lead by the director Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal), travels to Bolivia to shoot a movie about Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World. Structurally, it brings to mind some of Larry David’s more self-referential moments, but in a dramatic, instead of comedic, context. (Think the fourth season of _Seinfeld_, where Jerry and George create a show within a show, or the seventh season of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, where at one point, Larry David plays himself playing himself.) There are extended scenes of _Even the Rain_ that essentially show the finished product of what the Columbus film would look like. It's a credit to the filmmaking that these scenes carry an emotional impact even though that we know that, as a movie within a movie, it’s two levels removed from reality and requires double suspension of disbelief.  
  
Of course, if the movie relied on an interesting structure alone, it would devolve into gimmick. Thankfully, _Even the Rain_ effectively uses the layered structure to reflect the different attitudes of the characters and the ethical issues of the situation they find themselves in. It's clear that Sebastian's goal for his Columbus film is to denounce the mistreatment and exploitation of the Native Americans while lionizing the Spanish priests who defended the Natives' rights. At the same time, the film crew hires local Bolivians of Native descent as extras, and brag to their producers about having cheap labour. In other words, the themes of the film they're making reflect and contrast against the themes of the film that we, the audience, are watching.  
  
In particular, the character of the actor who plays Christopher Columbus in the inner film is very complex and multidimensional. As Columbus, he is completely inconsiderate towards the Natives, which is what the role requires. In his interactions with the other actors who play the heroic priests, he is callously skeptical of their idealism and doubts if they truly believe the same things that their characters believe. However, as the conflict with the Natives escalates, he shows yet another side to himself that was previously unexpected.  
  
All in all, _Even the Rain_ was entertaining and thought-provoking. It becomes a bit generic towards the climax, but I enjoyed the first act so much that it earns its melodramatic ending.  
  
**4 out of 5**
