I recently read a few books which make use of the relatively rare technique of second-person narration. This is when the pronoun _you_ is used as a perspective in the writing. Most books are either first-person (“_I_ went to the cobbler’s”) or third-person (“_She_ went to the haberdasher’s”), and it raises my eyebrows to see the _you_ usage. These three books use this technique for different reasons, and to varying degrees of success.

# [_Interior Chinatown_ by Charles Yu][1]

I really wanted to like this book. The protagonist of the story is Willis, the son of immigrants living in a U.S. Chinatown, a setting which lends himself to exactly the kind of cultural-identity soul-searching that I often do. There are passages in this book that hit me right in the heart, e.g.

> [Your father] says something you don't quite follow. You hear it, you catch most of the individual words, and yet somehow—you don't understand. This gap, always there. Somehow unbridgeable, whether it's across a wide Pacific gulf of language and culture, or just a simple sentence, father to son, always distance. The texture of everyday actions, simple movements and gestures, is harder than it looks. The great shame of your life that you can't speak his language, not really, not fluently.

As you can see, the prose is written in the second person. Why? That’s where the book fails for me. What you can’t see in the above quote is that the entire length of the book is typeset in a font that looks like a screenplay. There are also (some) dialogue sections that are formatted like that, with a character name centred and capitalized above the lines of dialogue. The conceit is supposed to be, Asian Americans have been portrayed in TV and movies as stock characters, like Old Asian Man, or Kung Fu Guy… but look, we don’t all follow the same script, see?

Unfortunately, I think that the stylistic flourishes obscure the story and the point. I spent half of the book wondering what exactly Willis even _is_: is he a character in a TV show, or is he an actor trying to get a part on a TV show? Both seem to be true at different points. Further, screenplays are not written in second-person, which confuses things even more.

what did I settle on in the second half?
