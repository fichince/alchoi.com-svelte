A while ago, I [posted an item](/blog/2007-03-07-thoughts-on-the-god-delusion-darwinism) about the word "Darwinism" and how I thought it had some bad connotations. This week, there was a column in the New York Times called "[Darwinism Must Die So That Evolution May Live](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/science/10essa.html?sq=darwinism&st=cse&scp=1&pagewanted=all "Darwinism Must Die So That Evolution May Live")" (free registration required). It has a similar theme but obviously more professionally written and better researched. In particular, one paragraph echoes some of the ideas in my original post.  

> Science has marched on. But evolution can seem uniquely stuck on its founder. We don’t call astronomy Copernicism, nor gravity Newtonism. "Darwinism" implies an ideology adhering to one man’s dictates, like Marxism. And "isms" (capitalism, Catholicism, racism) are not science. "Darwinism" implies that biological scientists "believe in" Darwin’s "theory." It’s as if, since 1860, scientists have just ditto-headed Darwin rather than challenging and testing his ideas, or adding vast new knowledge.  

Needless to say, I agree. I have no further comment on the matter. I only wanted to bask in self-congratulation. Thank you.
