During my recent trip to Cuba, I had the opportunity to observe the mysterious culture of the British people.... actually, it's more like, I had the opportunity to be completely confused by what they were talking about.  
  
I was sitting on a catamaran at the time, on a boat tour around some of the coral reefs near the island. A small boat is the perfect place for eavesdropping, as you can't help but overhear conversations in such a small space. Most of the other tourists on the boat were British, and one particular retirement-age couple were talking to the captain of the boat, a local Cuban man. They said to him, "Has anyone ever told you that you look like baba skins?"  
  
Baba skins?? Some sort of English culinary item? Like potato skins? I don't care how delicious it is, but I wouldn't want anyone telling me I look like a plate of food.  
  
"I'm not familiar with him. I like Rowan Atkinson, though, he is also British," said the boat captain.  
  
Okay, so it must be a British comedian or entertainer of some sort, as yet unknown in North America. Maybe "Baba Skins" is a goofy stage name, like Carrot Top. (Still thinking food, here.)  
  
The British couple tried to clarify. "He was in that Jennifer Lopez movie... _Maid In Manhattan._"
  
Hmm... haven't seen that one.  
  
"He was also in that cartoon... what was it called? _Roger Rabbit!_"  
  
Ah! BOB HOSKINS! Amazingly, the boat captain actually agreed: "Oh, yes, I do look like him!"
  
The funny thing is, he didn't even look like Bob Hoskins... he looked more like Phil Collins.
