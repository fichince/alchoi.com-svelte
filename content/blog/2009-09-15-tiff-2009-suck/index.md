I didn't watch [_Suck_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323605/) with 100% attentiveness because I was working as an usher/anti-piracy cop for the screening. (It really sucks watching a movie standing up and facing sideways.) But I did get enough of it to form an opinion. The movie is a comedy about a rock band where one of the members becomes a vampire.  
  
I liked some parts, and I would have been laughing out loud had I not been wearing my professional volunteer mask. There is a scene--a flashback sequence involving Malcolm McDowell's character, which incorporates footage of a young McDowell from some old movie--that was really well done. Ultimately though, the jokes were hit and miss, because it was kind of cheesy, goofy humour which doesn't always work for me. But I can see this becoming a "cult favourite" type of film with a good fanbase. Oh, and it's Canadian.
