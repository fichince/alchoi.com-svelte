I have never been a big fan of Apple. Their philosophy of computer-as-appliance has always struck me as a bit repulsive. It's easy to dislike Microsoft (and I do) for keeping everything closed and proprietary, but in some ways Apple is even worse. At least with a Windows PC, you can open the thing up and add and remove parts yourself.
  
Just look at the iPod, for example. The fact that it uses a non-standard connector to interface with the PC means that there are a whole bunch of products (e.g. USB cables) that you can't use with the iPod, and also that there are a whole bunch of iPod-specific products that don't work with anything else.  
  
Yeah, but that means the good Apple engineers can optimize for the hardware and make it work really fast...  
  
Uh... but it's harmful to consumers when these incompatibilities arise... it takes away their choices...  
  
That's okay, if everybody uses an iPod, then there won't be any incompatibilities... and it'll be really easy to find iPod-compatible products because all the manufacturers will be on the iPod bandwagon...  
  
But... but... Apple is an evil corporation... they're trying to take over the world!  
  
Just look at this iPod... it's so shiny and pretty... and cute..  
  
NOOOOO!!!!!  
  
Apple rulzzzzz!!!
