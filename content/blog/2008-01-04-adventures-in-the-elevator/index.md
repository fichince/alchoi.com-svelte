One of the effects of living in an apartment is that you spend a lot of time in the elevator. Of course, most of the time, you're just in there by yourself, staring at the wall. Or, if there's someone else in there with you, it's an awkward experience at best. As George Carlin put it, "there's nothing to do in an elevator except not look at the other guy." But, once in a while, the elevator will be the site of a bizarre happenstance.  
  
This morning, I was leaving to go to work. As I stood waiting for the elevator, I noticed that it was taking longer than usual to arrive at my floor. _Oh well_, I thought, _it's not like I'm in a hurry to get to work._  
  
The elevator eventually arrived, and the door slid open. Standing in the middle of the elevator was a puppy. Just a puppy. With nobody else inside. He was a small little white dog, a terrier of some sort, and wearing a red knit sweater. Not able to help myself, I let out a high-pitched "Awwww..."  
  
When I stepped into the elevator, I saw that the little guy (let's call him "Buddy," because what else do you call a dog you don't know?) was feeling scared, because his limbs were all shaking. I didn't know what to do, it's not really wise to try to confront a frightened animal. So I ignored him. There's nothing to do in an elevator except not look at the dog.  
  
Pretty soon the elevator stopped at another floor. A lady came in with another dog. Apparently this woman knew Buddy, because she started to talk to him and bending down like she was going to pick him up. "Where's your mommy? Where's your mommy?" Buddy's nervousness increased from this woman's overexuberance, and increased further as the other dog started growling (obviously jealous of the attention that Buddy was receiving). I tried to remember whether I had ever had a rabies shot.  
  
Fortunately, we reached the ground floor before the fur started flying. Buddy's owner ("mommy") was waiting. Apparently she and Buddy were about to come up the elevator when she ran into someone in the lobby and started to have a chat. Buddy had hopped into the elevator on his own before realizing that she had stayed behind. Poor Buddy. Poor, poor Buddy.
